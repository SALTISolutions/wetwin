    "# Wetwin widgets\n",
    "\n",
    "Ipywidgets is a great package for adding controls (buttons, sliders, checkboxes, etc) to your Jupyter notebooks. But after experimenting for some time it became clear that it's easy to create a very messy code. A major difficulty are the numerous links between the graphical elements that contrasts to the desire to write reusable code. The default GUI elemenents in IPyWidgets are reusable, but they need call backs and update methods to function. It is possible to hardwire all this from the outside, but the number of links increases rapidly with the number of widgets on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Centralized variables\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the variables represented eg by a slider are not linked to the other GUI elements. Below, we attempt an alternative approach where the widgets are linked by an object called a 'variable'. The aim is to use a 'variable' as a central point for connecting the gui elements. Multiple buttons, graphs, etc can be connected to the same variable and will be synchronized automatically. For example you can have two plots and one timeslider connected to the samevariable. When the slider is moved then both plots are updated. If you really need two separate time variables, then you can still create two variables and connect all gui elements to the relevant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IPyLeaflet\n",
    "\n",
    "IPyLeaflet is a python package for showing interactive maps in a jupyter notebook. We aim to extend the wetwin gui elements/widgets to IPyLeaflet in the near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development\n",
    "\n",
    "A disadvantage of this approach is that ipywidget gui elements need to be wrapped. It is unrealistic to wrap all of them in one go, so we'll have to live with missing gui elements. However, we'll keep the wrappers very small and you'll probably be able to adapt an existing one to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the dynamic variables and show how you can link them to other gui elements."
